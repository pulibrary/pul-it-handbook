# Inclusive Language

PUL IT strives to use inclusive language in all aspects of our work. This includes, but is not limited to, language used in communications, code, documentation, workflows, and 3rd party software selection.

Inclusive language avoids biases, slang, or expressions that discriminate against groups of people based on race, gender, or socioeconomic status. PUL IT actively seeks collaboration in identifying and addressing non-inclusive and harmful language that may appear in our work and artifacts.

If you encounter non-inclusive language in the course of your work, open an issue, submit a pull request, mention it on Slack, or add it to a meeting agenda.

The following table includes examples of alternate labels PUL IT has adopted for some common non-inclusive or harmful terms:
