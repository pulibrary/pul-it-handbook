# Tips for Assessing Technology Values

The following are some values that are important to us as a Library IT organization but are commonly overlooked in the context of a technology decision and thus we provide them as a reminder. We also provide some suggestions for evaluation of technology against these values. This is a guiding document, not a proscription. You might use these as part of an evaluation matrix or keep them in mind during some other decision-making process when choosing new technologies.

## Diversity, Equity & Inclusion
We want to ensure that the technologies we choose align with the library’s commitment to DEI reflected in its mission, vision, and north star statements. Below are a few ideas about how to evaluate each.

### Evaluating Diversity
* Look at a company’s hiring practices or policies.
* Look for public support from the company for diversity initiatives.
* How are conferences organized / programmed?
* Is the community measuring its own diversity? If yes, they at least care about this issue.

### Evaluating Equity
* Look at issue history for evidence that the organization has prioritized accessibility work.
* Assess the accessibility of the tool or product
* Is there evidence that the organization has implemented processes to mitigate biases in their technology or even recognize that they exist?

### Evaluating Inclusion
* Join a community chat and ask about the climate of the project.
* Look for project contribution guidelines and code of conduct documents.
* Look for blog posts or other statements about DEI from organizational leadership.
* Look through issue history for tickets about harm reduction or adding a code of conduct
* Was there a lot of drama / debate here? How was it handled by leadership?
* Is mentorship happening in this community?
* Is there a venue for public community discourse?

## Data Privacy and Ownership
Libraries have historically been protectors of privacy and confidentiality, which ALA notes are “necessary for intellectual freedom and fundamental to the ethics and practice of librarianship.” We seek to prioritize partnerships with communities and companies that share those values.

### Evaluating Data Privacy and Ownership
* Evaluate the business model of the organization and look for signs that user data is a source of profit. E.g. If the service is free, how?
* Consider the organization as a whole and not just the product in question.
* Businesses based in the EU are subject to stricter data privacy regulations than those based in the United States.
* Read the privacy policy for that product or technology and ensure it’s consistent with our values and privacy policy.
* What is the owning organization’s history on data privacy and how does data affect its business model?

## Service of Humanity
Consider the company or organization’s core mission and profit drivers. Are they aligned with Princeton’s motto to be “In the Nation's Service and the Service of Humanity”?

### Evaluating Service of Humanity
* Look for company or organizational statements or evaluations of environmental impact.
* Does the company treat its workers fairly?
* Do the company’s actions build strong communities?
* Prefer organizations whose motivations are in line with ours: e.g. the democratization of knowledge.
