### Step 1: Declare an incident
An incident is when we have a service outage, degraded service, or a security concern that needs immediate attention.
- [ ] Post in #incident_reports on Slack
```
@here We have the following incident: [Service] is [down|degraded|insecure].

Our goal in response is to learn about the causes, fix the issue, reflect on these, and take steps toward never having to respond to this particular issue again.

Everyone is encouraged to come, even if this system is not in your area of expertise. 

We need people in the following roles (all roles are transferrable and do not have to be the same person for the life of the incident):
- Incident moderator: Moderates the call, ensuring other roles are assigned and incident process is followed. Does not need to have technical expertise.
- Note taker: Takes notes and schedules post-incident meeting
- IT manager: Communicates to external stakeholders
- The Ensemble: Domain experts, learners
- Interpreter: Helps learners understand what's happening on the call, especially defining domain specific language. May summarize current situation as needed.
```
