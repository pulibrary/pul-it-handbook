## Activities

Pair with your mentor to do the following:
1. Use `psql` to connect to a staging database for one of your team's applications
1. In psql, use `\dt` to get a list of tables in the database
1. In psql, use `\d+ [table_name]` to get a list of columns in one of the tables
1. In psql, practice using `SELECT` queries.  Try using `GROUP BY` and `ORDER BY` clauses and anything else you want to try out.
1. In psql, start a transaction.  Try a `DELETE` or `UPDATE` query.  Rollback the transaction when you are done.
