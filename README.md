# PU Library The Hard Way

The repository walks you through the corner cases on PU Library. These are the
parts that are tricky to fully automate or in some cases not possible to.

The repository is mostly a way to learn about our environment which means things
will never "settle" in this repository.

## Target Audience

The target audience for this tutorial is any person planning to support
production application and needs to understand how things fit together. While it
is specific to PU Library it will be possible to use it in your environment.

## Services
