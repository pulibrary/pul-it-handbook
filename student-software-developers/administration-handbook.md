### Program Objectives

* Provide training and mentorship to students interested in software development
* Provide students with skills and experience relevant to being part of a software development team, as well as a remote work environment
* Provide development staff with mentorship, hiring, supervisory, onboarding, and training opportunities

### Hiring Objectives

We seek to hire students who will benefit the most from our curriculum and development practices. Candidates should demonstrate good communication skills, a willingness to learn, and the ability to work independently and as part of a team. In our hiring process we will work to counteract biases in tech internship hiring practices at large.

We'll meet as mentors every 2 weeks to check in about how things are going, share how we're doing things on different teams, and communicate reminders about things that happen each year.  We also coordinate on the #student-developer-mentors slack channel.
