### Access to the IT Suite Door

Ensure students have IT Suite Access.

1. Email [libdooraccess@princeton.edu](mailto:libdooraccess@princeton.edu)) – this can take a week
	-   In the past they have asked for the student ID. To get student IDs:
        -   log in to jobx/timesheetx
        -   Select Reporting > Standard Reports
        -   Click “My TimesheetX Reports” (or use the report called "All Employees Global Applications with Hire Dates")
        -   Select “Hire Details Report > Run report”
        -   If using the "All Employees" report, limit it to Job Title = "Student Software Developer 1".  Otherwise, no filters needed, click “Next”
        -   Select a Group by option, “group by student” is fine
        -   You don’t need to select a secondary sort, click “next”
        -   The report should come back basically right away, and has Student IDs on it.
   -   Alternatively, if you are logged into bibdata as an admin and you know the student's netid, you can visit https://bibdata.princeton.edu/patron/STUDENT_NET_ID and consult the university_id field.
    -   If libdooraccess isn't able to set up the access by the time students need it, you can also ask Tracy to give students this access.
1.   After the permissions are added to their cards, the student will need to refresh their cards at a hotspot in order to activate their permissions.
