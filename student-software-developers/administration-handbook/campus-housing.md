### Campus housing

Initially [campus housing](https://hres.princeton.edu/undergraduate-housing/current-students/seasonal-and-temporary-housing/summer-housing), which is available in June and July and opens for applications in early April played a role in determining this schedule. That is less relevant now that we allow students to work remotely during the summer.

If the student will apply for campus housing, the mentor will need to:
- Wait for the student developer to apply for campus housing
- Approve an Individual Housing Approval Form (you will get an email from SN@P)
- Fill out the Summer Registration Portal form as well.

The library does not provide any housing stipend.
