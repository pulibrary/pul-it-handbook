### All-hands

If a student developer is working locally, they are welcome to join all-hands.  In 2023,
there was not sufficient budget to cover travel costs for student developers to attend
all-hands.

Prior to all-hands:

1. Each mentor should review the all-hands schedule with their mentee, and identify
which meetings would be beneficial to attend.
1. If the mentee is not on campus, ensure that those meetings have a good remote option.
1. Make sure that student developers have clear guidance about what projects and/or
curriculum they should do when not in meetings, since all-hands will take a lot of the
mentor's focus.
