### Recruitment

#### Advertising the position

* Ask [Colleen Kenny](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/people/profile/ckenny) to send out the position to any student who has taken a CS course.

#### (Optional) 1st week of February: Host a table at the Student Employment Office’s Spring Job Fair

We did this in 2023. 11 people signed our interest form, but none of them applied for either of our positions, so it may not make sense to do this again.

-   Brandon in the communications office made us some signs and loaned us a library-branded tablecloth.
	-   Tablecloth: There were definitely people who approached looking for more general library jobs. It would be good to know where to direct these inquiries. Or maybe just don't have a tablecloth
	-   Signs: said, "Full-Time Summer Jobs" and "Software Development and UX / Web Development." Maybe add the word "mentorship" to one of these or a third sign? Maybe say "full-time summer jobs in software development at the library"?
	   -   Sign-up sheet:
		    -   Heading: "Summer Software and UX Web Developer - Sign up and I'll email you the job listings"
		    - Columns: Name, email address, class year (so we can properly inform seniors). Add a column for which position they’re interested in.

#### Background on CS departments and advertising strategies

* There are 2 ways to major in Computer Science at Princeton. You can apply and matriculate to the School of Engineering and Applied Science, or you can do the major through the standard BA program. The Undergraduate Affairs Administrator for the School of Engineering, [Traci Miller](https://engineering.princeton.edu/engage/leadership-and-staff), has also posted our position to the Princeton engineering student job listserv in the past. However, an email from Colleen should reach those students as well.
* In the School of engineering students declare their majors at the end of their freshman year. Students in the BA program declare majors at the end of their sophomore year.
