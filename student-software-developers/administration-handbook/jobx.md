#### Additional information

There are 2 pdfs of training materials in the [student hiring folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1MTfYgMHMb4FZpUQDqsLWasTqm6QMrdoe)
* Part 2 has some info on timesheet approval process
* When a student fills out a timesheet, you get an email that it's been filled out and you can go approve it.
* If the student doesn't fill out their timesheet, the system will send you an email saying there's a delinquent timesheet. You can then email them and tell them to fill it out, or you can "take possession" and dismiss it if they didn't work during that time.
* If you forget to approve a timesheet the system will email you.
