### Laptops

Students are provided a MacBook Pro by the library. We have 6 total student
machines, purchsed on the following dates:

- 2019 - 3 machines (retired)
- May of 2023 (2 new machines)
- September 2023 (3 new machines -- we ordered 4 but didn't use one of them and it may have been given to someone else)

There’s not an official equipment replacement cycle as far as I know, but we agreed to replace them every 4 years. Ask for new machines to be ordered as soon as we know we need them; Desktop support appreciates lead time.

At the end of the year, laptops for students who will return in the fall can be placed in Steph’s office and should be labeled with the student’s name. Laptops that will be reimaged should be labeled as such and also placed in Steph’s office -- she will pass them on to the desktop support team.

Desktop support will ship new and reimaged machines to the new group of summer student developers, or students can pick them up directly.
