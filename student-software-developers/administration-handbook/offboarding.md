### Offboarding

Students should be offboarded according to your team’s offboarding procedure. Student computers should be returned to Traci Hall for her team to reimage for the next group of student developers with 3 weeks of lead time if possible. There should be plenty of time between the last day of work for Spring students and the first day for Summer students. Create an lsupport ticket when they’re ready to be reimaged.

If a student needs to leave their position before the end of a term, [SE has a form we fill out](https://princeton.studentemployment.ngwebsolutions.com/Cux_ContactDetail.aspx?PurposeId=22)
