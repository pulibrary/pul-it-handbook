# Resume Selection
We may have a large number of applicants for the positions. The initial screen of resumes can be very time intensive, so we want to make the resume review process efficient.  

If possible the two roles should be separate folks.

## Roles ([see roles for a complete list of hiring roles](https://github.com/pulibrary/pul-it-handbook/blob/main/student-software-developers/administration-handbook/roles.md))
 * Initial point of contact 
 * Initial document organization
 * Resume Reviewer

### Initial point of contact
The Initial point of contact is the person that gathers work samples from the students.
The Initial point of contact: 
   1. Has their email on the job posting
   1. Reaches out to the student if the information is not complete.

### Resume Acceptor
The Resume Acceptor is the person who redacts the resumes and set them up for review.  This may or may not be the same person as the Initial point of contact, but likely is the same person.
   1. Redacts Personal Names and Business Names from the Resume and cover letters
       * You can do this in Preview (Mac) or LibreOffice Draw (cross-platform).  If you use LibreOffice Draw, be sure to "Export redacted PDF" rather than the typical "Export" option. 
   1. Stores the information under the student netid on a google drive accessible to the committee
   1. Creates and maintains a spreadsheet that has the netid, a link to the content and a slot for two reviewers [see template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rw_kw7psuiWlvJtjbfwyXjWxPsyfNCqSIWafj4Gm5YE/edit#gid=0) 

### Resume Reviewers
If possible, each resume should be reviewed by at least 2 people. This job can be distributed throughout the hiring committee. The Resume reviewers will:
  1. select a number of resumes to review from the spreadsheet created by the Resume Acceptor
  1. Review the resumes for required experience and need and fill in the spreadsheet
