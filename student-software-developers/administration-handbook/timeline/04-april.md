### Early April: order laptops

Email lsupport and ask for new machines to be ordered, if needed.

### Early April: Prepare Tiny Workshops schedule
- Create a spreadsheet in the [Tiny workshops google drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10_hdO4JVu3cVxgUo1gQqFSm5_JH2bEzY) (copy last year's if you like)
    - Update the topics and dates
- Review the [Instruction sheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yD6np5ME8zHg-90FuBERUbqiVTC5UAbrMFVJFlysNsM/edit) and update if needed
- Post the instructions in the #it-general slack channel when it's ready

### Late April: prepare for first day


-   If new machines are being shipped, coordinate with lsupport and the new student developer for them to get the new laptop.  They can be shipped, or, if the student developer is still on campus, picked up from Firestone.
-   Schedule welcome / onboarding meeting, the first round of dev stories, workshops.
-   (Optional) You may want to populate your calendar with timesheet due / review dates. See [https://finance.princeton.edu/payroll-labor-accounting/payroll/payroll-basics/monthly-and-biweekly-payroll-cycles](https://finance.princeton.edu/payroll-labor-accounting/payroll/payroll-basics/monthly-and-biweekly-payroll-cycles). The system sends email reminders, though.

#### Ensure students have IT Suite Access

If any students will be on campus for the summer, [get them access to the IT Suite](../it-suite-access.md).

### End of Spring semester: celebrate current student developers!

- At the end of the Spring semester, thank our students by taking them out to lunch or coffee, or bringing them treats in the office.
- Have a farewell zoom with the team.
- Ask students who will return to make sure their name is on their machine.
- Ask students who won’t return to put their machine wherever we’ve agreed that Library IT Support will pick them up (we have used Stephanie Ayers’s office for this).
- [Offboard students who won't return](../offboarding.md)
