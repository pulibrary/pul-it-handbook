### August: Prep for fall

-   Email the student employment office and ask them to extend the positions through the academic year. They needed the netids of all the students.
-   Arrange the students first 1-3 workshifts. Some students are more sure about their schedule than others at this point. Add-drop period is the first 2 weeks of class so expect schedules to shift during that time.
-   [Get students access to the IT Suite](../it-suite-access.md) for the Fall.
-   Hold a retro with mentors and students about the training curriculum.    
-   Once the retro is done, discuss how the curriculum timing went. Determine start / end dates for the next summer. Add important dates to the DLS Student Developers calendar. Our typical start date is the day after memorial day, and typical last day is two weeks before labor day.
	-   Generally this will be 12 weeks, (note that one of those weeks will be all hands). There are some years where there’s an extra week between memorial day and labor day, not sure what will happen with the school calendar on those years. Next one is in 2026.
-   If summer and fall students want to all get together for a meal when they return to campus, we can pay them for that time, but we can’t pay for the meal. This would be for them to organize if they want to.
