    Hello,
    We would like to continue our student part time in the fall.
 
    Our job is scheduled to end September [DATE FROM JOBX], but we would like the students to continue in the fall.
 
    Would you please update the current job to allow us to hire the students for the Fall and Spring semester?
 
    Our specific job is https://princeton.studentemployment.ngwebsolutions.com/JobX_ManageJob.aspx?JobId=7046
 
    Here are their emails from the system:

    Thanks!

-   Arrange the students first 1-3 workshifts. Some students are more sure about their schedule than others at this point. Add-drop period is the first 2 weeks of class so expect schedules to shift during that time.
-   [Get students access to the IT Suite](../it-suite-access.md) for the Fall.
-   Hold a retro with mentors and students about the training curriculum.    
-   Once the retro is done, discuss how the curriculum timing went. Determine start / end dates for the next summer. Add important dates to the DLS Student Developers calendar. Our typical start date is the day after memorial day, and typical last day is two weeks before labor day.
	-   Generally this will be 12 weeks, (note that one of those weeks will be all hands). There are some years where there’s an extra week between memorial day and labor day, not sure what will happen with the school calendar on those years. Next one is in 2026.
-   If summer and fall students want to all get together for a meal when they return to campus, we can pay them for that time, but we can’t pay for the meal. This would be for them to organize if they want to.
- Re-hire returning students at the higher classification: "Student Developer II"
    - Get the student's employee ID from JobX.  You can find it from the old job, by clicking on the Application. 
    - Go to the [Manage Job for Student Developer II](Student Developer II) in JobX
    - click "hire an applicant"
    - Enter the student's first name, last name, and employee ID
    - Enter the fund code A0000 (IT) and click “search” to get the combo code generated.
    - Add the Primary Supervisor and Secondary Supervisors
    - Press the Hire button
    - The student will now appear under JobX > Hires Requests
