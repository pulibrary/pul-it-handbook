### December: prepare the position

Big IT companies tend to hire for summer internships in the fall. We aren't really trying to compete with those programs, but we want to start our hiring at the beginning of the spring semester so that there are still plenty of students looking for summer opportunities.

-   Determine who will be mentoring students, and who will be part of the hiring group
    - Ask team leads to let us know who will mentor a student for the upcoming summer and school year. It's okay if there is uncertainty, but teams should be able to let the group of current mentors know the parameters of this uncertainty (e.g., "as a team we definitely want 2 students, and we know that one student is coming back so if our other student doesn't return then Alice will mentor but if they do return then Brandon will continue as a mentor")
-   Review / finalize required / desired qualifications and job ad -- see [Job Descriptions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cA1V8GTcqeEtP_LVudi1LOA-nYBWRCNgB2380JSg2mU/edit)
-   Review or create a rubric from required / desired and ensure each reflects the other, as well as our hiring goals
-   Create a position in the “jobx” [student employment website](http://princeton.edu/se).
-   Review the jobx training documents in this folder.
-   If re-opening the previous position, clear the prior applicants so they don’t clutter the applicant list.
-   We were approved to pay $20/hr. This is above the highest salary grade, which requires a small compensation review. We were able to get our pay rate approved by requiring software development experience. This approval was carried over when we re-posted the job so shouldn’t be required each time.


### Mid December: ask current students if they will return

Determine which students will work for the next summer and/or fall so we’re ready to start this process again when we get back from winter holidays. If a student needs to think about it over winter break that’s okay, as long as they let us know right when they get back.
