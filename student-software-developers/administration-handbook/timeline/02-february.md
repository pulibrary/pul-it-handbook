### Early February: Perform search

#### (Optional) 1st week of February: Host a table at the Student Employment Office’s Spring Job Fair

We did this in 2023. 11 people signed our interest form, but none of them applied for either of our positions, so it may not make sense to do this again.

-   Brandon in the communications office made us some signs and loaned us a library-branded tablecloth.
	-   Tablecloth: There were definitely people who approached looking for more general library jobs. It would be good to know where to direct these inquiries. Or maybe just don’t have a tablecloth
	-   Signs: said, "Full-Time Summer Jobs" and "Software Development and UX / Web Development." Maybe add the word "mentorship" to one of these or a third sign? Maybe say "full-time summer jobs in software development at the library"?
	   -   Sign-up sheet:
		    -   Heading: "Summer Software and UX Web Developer - Sign up and I’ll email you the job listings"
		    - Columns: Name, email address, class year (so we can properly inform seniors). Add a column for which position they’re interested in.

#### 2nd week of February: Review applications

After about the 2nd week of classes, review all the applications at once, then set up interviews.

-   As we meet to review candidates and choose who to interview, update the job status to "Active, not listed" in the system.
-   Offer an interview slot to each selected applicant (Use [Sample emails](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1G__PXgp6DZd9-EomEyHutr9CvZlNzudZ3kXfmb4BDxA/edit)). Tip for scheduling interviews: block out times in advance, and block out 2 slots per candidate. Use color-coding to show which slots are scheduled, which have been offered, and which are still available to offer to candidates. Only offer 2 slots to each candidate, and if neither works offer them some different slots. This prevents having to wait for a response from any given candidate before being able to offer slots to someone else. Sometimes a student won’t reply or will take a couple of days to reply.
-   Send an email to each student the day before their interview to give them the interview questions. It’s a good idea to prepare these ahead of time and automate their send.


### Early February: Performance review for continuing student developers

For students who will return the following year, do a performance review. Also offer this option to all students. They will do a brief self-assessment and we will write a narrative review. More information is in the [Feedback / Assessment Worksheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VkdHNC794q0KG6mUvCTrvHM-CU4ngGZhSchP4yd4xaU/edit).
