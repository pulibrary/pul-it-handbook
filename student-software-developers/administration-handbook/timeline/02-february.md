### Early February: Perform search

[Continue recruiting candidates and advertising the position](../recruitment.md).

#### 2nd week of February: Review applications

After about the 2nd week of classes, review all the applications at once, then set up interviews. See the [resume selection page](../resume-selection.md).

-   As we meet to review candidates and choose who to interview, update the job status to "Active, not listed" in the system.
-   Offer an interview slot to each selected applicant (Use [Sample emails](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1G__PXgp6DZd9-EomEyHutr9CvZlNzudZ3kXfmb4BDxA/edit)). Tip for scheduling interviews: block out times in advance, and block out 2 slots per candidate. Use color-coding to show which slots are scheduled, which have been offered, and which are still available to offer to candidates. Only offer 2 slots to each candidate, and if neither works offer them some different slots. This prevents having to wait for a response from any given candidate before being able to offer slots to someone else. Sometimes a student won’t reply or will take a couple of days to reply.
-   Send an email to each student the day before their interview to give them the interview questions. It’s a good idea to prepare these ahead of time and automate their send.


### Early February: Performance review for continuing student developers

For students who will return the following year, do a performance review. Also offer this option to all students. They will do a brief self-assessment and we will write a narrative review. More information is in the [Feedback / Assessment Worksheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VkdHNC794q0KG6mUvCTrvHM-CU4ngGZhSchP4yd4xaU/edit).
