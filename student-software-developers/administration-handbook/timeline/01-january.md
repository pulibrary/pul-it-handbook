### Mid January: Post the position

-   2 weeks before first day of classes: post the position. When we do it at this time we get more applicants, I think because they are looking for spring positions.
-   [Advertise the position](../recruitment.md)
    

#### Prepare search documents

-   Create a folder for this year’s general search materials in the [Student Employees Hiring folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/1gzyj1Oc7ELChwTCKdiwmNVD-l3l5FIWq). Copy the contents of the previous year’s folder and move that one to the “Hiring Archive” folder.
-   Create a shared drive for this year’s private search materials. Share it with the rest of the search group. It should not be in the ITIMS shared drive, which is shared with all of IT and very likely the student employees we hire. It will contain:
    -   The hiring contact status spreadsheet - copy from the template in [Hiring](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/1gzyj1Oc7ELChwTCKdiwmNVD-l3l5FIWq)
    -   The rubric - copy from the template in [Hiring](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/1gzyj1Oc7ELChwTCKdiwmNVD-l3l5FIWq)
    -   A folder for each candidate interviewed containing
		-   Resume
		-   code sample
		-   text from their online application (optional)
		-   a copy of the interview agenda for adding candidate-specific questions
	    -   Create a notes folder and document in [Notes](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/1qBVzjAp7eaxBUVnehC3YX2wEqmjJdMh0).
-   Add links to the new folder, new drive, and this documentation at the top of the notes document.

#### Plan interviews

-   Finalize Interview questions
-   Ensure the questions are aligned to the qualifications - explicitly link them in the rubric
-   Finalize interview agenda
