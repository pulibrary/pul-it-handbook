### Early November: Plan for next year

#### With students

After students get back from fall break, let them know we'll be asking them if they want to return for the summer, or for next year.

If they're interested in returning, talk to them about what goals they might have for the summer or for next year, and think together about new opportunities for learning either in software development or as a peer mentor.

After 1 year of work, students get a "level 2" position with a small raise.

#### With staff

Check with team leads to see whether anyone is hoping to hire and mentor a student for a type of position we haven't hired before. If so they should start working with their team lead and potentially other student mentors to write a position description.
