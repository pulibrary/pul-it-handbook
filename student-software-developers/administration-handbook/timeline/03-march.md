### Early-Mid March: Make offers and hire

#### Making offers

-   Use [Sample emails](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1G__PXgp6DZd9-EomEyHutr9CvZlNzudZ3kXfmb4BDxA/edit).
-   Each staff member should directly extend the offer to the student they will work with. Mention the anticipated start date in this email.

#### Hire

-   Scheduling: Set start / end dates, daily summer hours with the student.    
-   If you don't yet have one, [create a jobx account](../jobx.md)
-   Hire each student in the jobx system.
-   If the student has worked a campus job before they’ll likely have the required paperwork on file
-   If the student doesn’t have the required paperwork, you “initiate” the hire by filling out the form, and then SE contacts the student to work with them on getting the paperwork done. [Documentation for students about that process](https://finaid.princeton.edu/student-employment/information-undergraduates/prior-working) is on the financial aid website.
-   In the “create a hire record” step set the start / end dates of the position. Use the agreed-upon start date (usually the day after memorial day). The system should auto-fill the last date of the summer work session.    
	-   Enter the fund code A0000 (IT) and click “search” to get the combo code generated.
	-   Form should auto-fill Department code 41006 (Library) and account code 5252 (used for undergraduates).
	-   Put the mentor as the primary supervisor
    -   Put the other members of your team who will be mentoring students as secondary supervisors
-   Once jobs are accepted, email other applicants to let them know the position is closed and thank them for applying.
	-   For applicants we interviewed, send them individual emails.
    -   For other applicants, use the multi-select option in jobx to email multiple people at once.
    -   Use text from [Sample emails](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1G__PXgp6DZd9-EomEyHutr9CvZlNzudZ3kXfmb4BDxA/edit).
    -   Consider a more personal email to those who we ranked highly. For example, a rising 2nd year might be encouraged to apply again.
 -   You can leave the position status as “Active, not listed.” SE office says there’s not a big distinction between this status vs “inactive” so it doesn’t really matter much.
 -   Have a small retro with the hiring team and then update this documentation with process changes we should make.
