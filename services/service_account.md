#### Creating a Princeton Service Account

A service account is a Princeton single-sign on account that is tied to a service instead of an individual person. "Service Now" is the brand name of some software that OIT uses to track requests. Here is how to use Service Now to request a service account. You might need this if, for example, you need an email address for something your whole team needs to access.

1. Fill in the ticket in [service now](https://princeton.service-now.com/service?id=sc_cat_item_guide&table=sc_cat_item&sys_id=e2e6c6501b7ace10b46dc5d96e4bcbd6&searchTerm=service%20account)

   - You will follow a wizard that will depend on your use case
   - Remember to add at least one other team member (it is restricted to one additional user only)

1. After the account is set up a password must be selected and stored in lastpass

1. Duo will be enabled and the first person to enable it will always get extraneous duo (Just ignore duo for the service account unless asked)
1. Other folks will follow https://princeton.service-now.com/service?id=kb_article&sys_id=575eff5387064dd012ae43bd0ebb35b0#section5 to add their device to duo. Make sure to name the device with your name.
