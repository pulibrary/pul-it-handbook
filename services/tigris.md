## Infolinx/Tigris

Tigris is a service hosted by [AISWW](https://aisww.com/support/).

### Purpose
Records management software used by both University staff and Library staff in the Library's Records Management. Anne-Marie Phillips is the primary contact for the software. The software product name for this is "Infolinx". [Further information](https://aisww.com/infolinx/). Our implementation is called Tigris.

### Access
Web [tigris login](https://tigris.princeton.edu). You can log into Tigris using your Princeton SSO credentials, as authentication is integrated with our campus IDP. Some Princeton people outside the library also deposit materials to this site. Authorization is governed by membership in certain Active Directory groups established specifically for Tigris. These need to be managed via OIT's [web tools portal](https://tools.princeton.edu).
