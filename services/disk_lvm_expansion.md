## Expanding a logical volume with an additional disk

You can add storage space to an existing virtual machine without shutting it down by adding a new disk to the VM, then expanding the existing logical volume to include the new space. 

### Confirm that a logical volume exists

The existing partition must be a logical volume (LVM) for these steps to work. Identify the partition type with `sudo fdisk -l` (or run the command as the root user). Notice that each attached disk has both a `Disk` entry and a `Device` entry. You should see a device with the ID (hex code) `8e` and the Type `Linux LVM`, which denotes a logical volume.

```bash
sudo fdisk -l
```

You will see output similar to this:

```bash

Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes

Disk /dev/mapper/lib--vg-swap_1: 980 MiB, 1027604480 bytes, 2007040 sectors
Units: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
```

In the example output above, `/dev/sda1` is a Linux logical volume. Once you confirm that you are working with a logical volume, you can continue.

### Create a new disk in vSphere

In the vSphere UI, select the VM and add a new disk of the desired size.

### Connect to the VM and become the root user

SSH into the VM and do `sudo su root` to change users to the root user. You cannot execute the commands in this procedure just using `sudo`.

### Detect and connect the new disk

The steps here are not needed if you have power cycled the VM. Once the physical disk has been added at the hardware level, you must connect the new disk to the operating system and create a new partition that makes use of this additional space.

First, check that the new unallocated disk space is detected by the server. Run `df -h` to view the available disk space. You will most likely see that the disk space is still showing as the original size. Re-run `sudo fdisk -l` to list all the disks. The new disk will be the last in the alphabetical list (for example, if the machine has `/dev/sda` through `/dev/sdd`, the new disk is `/dev/sdd`. Likewise, in `/sys/class/scsi_host/` the new disk will be the host with the largest number. To connect the new disk with the operating system on the VM without rebooting the VM, you must rescan all devices by running the command below as root. **Use the largest available `host#` on your specific VM.**

```bash
for host in /sys/class/scsi_host/*; do echo "- - -" | sudo tee $host/scan; ls /dev/sd* ; done
```

### Partition the new disk

Re-run `sudo fdisk -l` after the command above to confirm that you see a new disk. You will now notice a new entry (typically) `/dev/sdb` (YMMV). The new disk will have a `Disk` entry but no `Device` entry yet.

To partition this new disk, run:

```bash
fdisk /dev/sdb
```

The `fdisk` command kicks off an interactive script that creates a partition on the new disk. Use the inputs shown below to work through the script. You can press `m` at any time to get a full listing of `fdisk` commands. For a full example, see the output of the interactive script below the list of inputs.

 - select **`n`** for a new partition.
 - press enter to accept the default **`p`** for a primary partition.
 - press enter again to accept the **(default)** for the partition number. (YMMV)
 - press enter again to accept the **(default)** for the first sector of the unallocated space. (YMMV)
 - press enter again to select the **(default)** for the last sector of the unallocated space. (YMMV)
 - select **`t`** to set the type.
 - optionally type **`L`** to list all available disk types.
 - select **`8e`** for a Linux logical volume, so you can join the new disk space to the original `/dev/sda1` Linux LVM.
 - select **`w`** to write the new partition table and get you out of this shell.

 ```bash
 fdisk /dev/sdb
 ```
 
 You will see output like this: 

 ```bash

 Changes will remain in memory only, until you decide to write them.
 Be careful before using the write command.

### Create a physical volume

The `pvcreate` command creates a physical volume for later use by the logical volume manager (LVM). In this example, the physical volume will be the new `/dev/sdb1` partition.

```bash
pvcreate /dev/sdb1
```
You will see output like this:

```bash
  Physical volume "/dev/sdb1" successfully created.
```

Now you should see a `Device` as well as a `Disk` in the output of `fdisk -l`.

### Extend the logical volume

Next, extend the existing logical volume to include the new device. First, confirm the name of the current volume group using the `vgdisplay` command:

```bash
vgdisplay
```
You will see output like this:

```bash
  --- Volume group ---
  VG Name               lib-vg
  System ID             
  Format                lvm2
  Metadata Areas        3
  Metadata Sequence No  7
  VG Access             read/write
  VG Status             resizable
  MAX LV                0
  Cur LV                2
  Open LV               2
  Max PV                0
  Cur PV                3
  Act PV                3
  VG Size               <339.99 GiB
  PE Size               4.00 MiB
  Total PE              87037
  Alloc PE / Size       87037 / <339.99 GiB
  Free  PE / Size       0 / 0   
  VG UUID               hbeBYx-treH-UAUZ-0MZE-vBxN-FvFv-3zqHjx
```

Next, extend the volume group by adding in the physical volume `/dev/sdb1` which you created using the `pvcreate` command earlier. Pass the VG Name from the output above (in this example, `lib-vg`) to the `vgextend` command:

```bash
vgextend lib-vg /dev/sdb1
```
You will see output like this:

```bash
  Volume group "lib-vg" successfully extended
```

Confirm these changes using the `pvscan` command to scan all disks for physical volumes. The output should confirm the original `/dev/sdb1` partition and the newly created physical volume `/dev/sdb1`:

```bash
pvscan
```

You will see output like this:

```bash
  PV /dev/sda1   VG lib-vg          lvm2 [<40.00 GiB / 0    free]
  PV /dev/sdb1   VG lib-vg          lvm2 [<200.00 GiB / 0    free]
  PV /dev/sdc1   VG lib-vg          lvm2 [<100.00 GiB / 0    free]
  PV /dev/sdd1   VG lib-vg          lvm2 [<100.00 GiB / <100.00 GiB free]
  Total: 4 [439.98 GiB] / in use: 4 [439.98 GiB] / in no VG: 0 [0   ]
```

Next, extend the logical volume (we already did the physical volume) which basically means we will be taking our original logical volume and extending it over our new partition/physical volume of `/dev/sdb1`.

Confirm the path of the logical volume using `lvdisplay` (YMMV)

```bash
lvdisplay
```

You will see output like this:

```bash
  --- Logical volume ---
  LV Path                /dev/lib-vg/root
  LV Name                root
  VG Name                lib-vg
  LV UUID                kccyDY-a9GB-VoV4-MwUi-SHcO-ScwJ-eVIrPR

  LV Path                /dev/lib-vg/swap_1
  LV Name                swap_1
  VG Name                lib-vg
  LV UUID                c8RAPC-TCbR-lQff-tPIN-DxZN-XQZa-Nn4fgv
  LV Write Access        read/write

  LV Status              available
  # open                 2
  LV Size                980.00 MiB
  Current LE             245
  Segments               1
  Allocation             inherit
  Read ahead sectors     auto
  - currently set to     256
  Block device           253:1
```

Extend the logical volume using the `lvextend` command:

```bash
lvextend /dev/lib-vg/root /dev/sdb1
```

You will see output like this:


```bash
  Size of logical volume lib-vg/root changed from 339.03 GiB (86792 extents) to <439.03 GiB (112391 extents).
  Logical volume lib-vg/root successfully resized.
```

Finally, resize the overall `ext` based file system using the `resize2fs` command:

```bash
resize2fs /dev/lib-vg/root
```

You will see output like this:

```bash
resize2fs 1.44.1 (24-Mar-2018)
Filesystem at /dev/lib-vg/root is mounted on /; on-line resizing required
old_desc_blocks = 43, new_desc_blocks = 55
The filesystem on /dev/lib-vg/root is now 115088384 (4k) blocks long.
```

Confirm that the VM can now access the additional disk space using the `df` (disk free) command:

```bash
df -h
```

You will see output like this:

```bash
Filesystem                                 Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
