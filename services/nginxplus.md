We have 2 load balancer machines running nginxplus, lib-adc1 and lib-adc2

## Admin UI

On the Admin UI you can turn traffic on and off or view the status of any given machine.

To connect to the admin UI you must create an SSH tunnel from your machine
```
ssh -L 8080:localhost:8080 pulsys@lib-adc1
```
Then you can open up a web browse to the link http://localhost:8080

## Determine active machine

To figure out which machine is active:
- ssh to one of them
- `$ip a`
- look for inet `inet 128.112.203.146/32 scope global eno1` in `eno1`. If you see it that's the active machine.

## Update on live box

You may need to do this because the ansible scripts take a long time to run.

- config files are in /etc/nginx/conf.d
- sudo [your editor] to edit them.
- `sudo nginx -t` to test the config files are valid
- Reload nginx. (Restart if that doesnâ€™t work)
  - Reload: `$ sudo service nginx reload`
  - Restart: `$ sudo systemctl restart nginx`
  - You may need to check again that the machine you're on is still active.
- Repeat the edit and syntax check on the other load balancer machine. You don't
  need to reload or restart on this machine.
