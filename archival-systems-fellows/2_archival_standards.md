## Archival Standards

The landscape of archival standards is undergoing some radical changes at the moment with the release of Records in Contexts (RiC) by the International Council on Archives (ICA).

## Before RiC

In the United States, archivists have used Describing Archives: A Content Standard (DACS) and Encoded Archival Standards (EAS) in conjunction with controlled vocabularies and authorities to create descriptive records for archives.

DACS is a content standard maintained by the Society of American Archivists (SAA). The role of a content standard is to provide guidance to practitioners on how to construct a descriptive record: what piees of information should the record capture in order to support user functions, from which sources should archivists gather them, and what rules or patterns should they follow when adding them to the record.

DACS is the US implementation of the ICA's International Standard on Archival Description--General (ISAD(G)). 

EAS consists of a suite of XML schemata including Encoded Archival Description (EAD), Encoded Archival Context (Corporate Bodies, Persons, and Families) (EAC-CPF), and Encoded Archival Functions (EAF). The first standard of the suite, EAD, is itself an implementation of ISAD(G) and precedes DACS by seven years, making it a hybrid standard that combines features of a data structure and transmission standard with those of a content standard.

A growing number of archives in the US and abroad are adopting ArchivesSpace as their content management system. The ArchivesSpace data model is informed by DACS and EAD but also differs in important aspects. It may be considered a de-facto standard of practice in its own right.


## RiC

RiC v1.0 was released as the successor standard of ISAD(G) (and its related standards) in December 2023. It consists of an introduction, a conceptual model, an ontology, and yet-to-be-released application guidelines.

RiC is a departure from current descriptive practice in several ways. It radically redefines the domain concepts archivists have implicitly been working with, most notably in the way it teases out the intellectual from the physical description. It also assumes implementation as linked data, and contains an OWL ontology. 

RiC does not consider content standards as complementary.

While SAA has not yet formally adopted RiC, the latest development cycle of EAD (EAD4) is working towards aligning with RiC.
