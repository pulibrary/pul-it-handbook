## What are archives?

An "archive" in the singular means records created and maintained by a person, organization, or family as part of their activties and received/collected and maintained by the creator or another party because of their continuing value.

In the plural, "archives" usually means a collection of multiple archives, usually held by an institution.

An "Archive" or "Archives" (capitalized) usually means a particular repository where archives are held, e.g. "The National Archives."

## What is archival description?

Archival description is the process of creating data that describes an archival resource. The product of archival description is a record. 

Archival materials are traditionally conceived of as aggregates, not individual items. Their description is generally hierarchical, going from largest to smallest, such as from a collection or fonds to its ever-smaller component aggregates, like series or files. Some collections will be described in great hierarchical depth while others may only be described at a series level. Many materials are never described at the individual level. This is both practical, because many of a recordâ€™s characteristics are shared by other materials at some aggregate level, and necessary, because a single collection may contain far too many records for an archivist to describe or researcher to review. 

Similarly, most physical archival collections are housed as aggregates in containers, generally within file folders within boxes. This approach protects materials from damage like crumpling or crushing. It also breaks a collection into manageable chunks. Boxes are efficient enough to move large collections during a reshelving project or library move and small enough for a person to handle during paging. They may be labeled, barcoded, and tracked without altering the materials they contain. And they are flexible enough to allow for adding material to a collection or other aggregate over time, either by adding a box or by adding to a box.

Intellectual aggregates are not necessarily housed together physically in the same box. Nor will boxes containing materials from the same intellectual aggregation necessarily be shelved together. Material housing and shelving may reflect the original order of the materials, accruals over time, processing decisions, shelving efficiencies, and institutional considerations.
