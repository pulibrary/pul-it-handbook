## Iterative Processing

Iterative processing describes the process by which archivists establish intellectual control over a body of materials in increments of specificity.
It allows archivists to make the materials discoverable on a high level quickly.

### Levels of description

Prior to the start of a processing project, a repository usually makes some decisions about the processing goals, timeline, and resources (level of staffing, conservation, materials etc.) they will invest in the project.
For example, there may be faculty or researchers waiting to use the collection, which may prompt an accelerated project timeline.

Part of that planning is a decision about the so-called level of description at which the collection should be processed. 
It simply means how detailed the resulting record will be. It may also impact activities such as physical rehousing or arrangement. 

Two kinds of "levels" come into play when we talk about the level of description:

1. what *parts* of the collection we're describing and
2. how *rich* the description is.

#### 1. Levels of the collection

Archivists conceive of "collections" or "fonds" as bodies of material that make up a whole.
(What makes a "collection" or "fonds" is a story for another day. Let's just mention that provenance tends to be an important criterion, though by no means the only one.)
DACS calls a record that describes only the collection as a whole but not its constituent components a "single-level" record.

Within a collection, archivists may also identify groupings of materials that form functional units (archivists in the US call those "series"), groupings within those groupings ("subseries"), and subsequent groupings within those ("files", which may contain other "files").
At the "lowest" level of a collection sit individual "items", which may be individually described (but typically aren't).
DACS calls a record that describes a collection and any of its constituent components, regardless of depth, a "multi-level" record.

#### 2. Levels of the record

Just like a bibliographic record, an archival record may be a minimal or fuller record.
The levels of fullness of a record are described in DACS.
A minimal record, i.e. one that contains the bare minimum of fields required for identification of the material, is called a "required" record. 
A record that additionally contains a scope note, biographical or administrative history note, and access points is called an "optimum" record.
Any record that contains those and additional fields is called an "added value" record.

###

Taken together, these two kinds of levels make up the "level of description." 

For example, a collection might be described at the collection level, i.e. the record will only make statements that apply to the collection as a whole. Within that, it may be a minimal record, i.e. a DACS "single-level required" record. Or it may be a very rich record, i.e. a DACS "single-level added value" record.

On the other end of the spectrum, a record might describe the collection down to the subseries or file level. DACS would call that a "multi-level" record. Again, a multi-level record could be a multi-level required, multi-level optimum, or multi-level added value record depending on the fields used.

To establish intellectual control quickly and make the material discoverable and accessible quickly, archivists often publish successively more detailed records in **iterations**.

For example, they may first publish a single-level required record that tells users little more than the title of the collection, some dates, the extent of the collection, and an identifier that allows patrons to make a request to see the collection. They may then update that record with a box inventory and some access points. Then they may go back yet again and start identifying broad groupings that they publish in a multi-level record or finding aid. And so on, to the desired level of detail.
