## Source of Acquisition

The material was purchased from Mr. Gest in August 1948. It was logged with accession #AM 13719.

We know that Mr. Gest acquired the collection from one Felix Limongi. Limongi in turn acquired many of the papers from the offices of the New Orleans law firm Durant & Hornor, though he may have added some material from other sources. A note left by Limongi states that he came across the Marie Claire Chabert records sometime before March 1926 while collecting postage stamps, though it is unclear from available documentation if he also acquired them via Durant & Hornor.
