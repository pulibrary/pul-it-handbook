## Programming Languages

Consider this as your benefit. A good DevOps engineer knows at least one popular programming language. At PUL we have experienced programmers who work with Ruby. We believe the best way to learn programming is by pairing with a more experienced programmer. To begin we encourage using whatever platform you want to familiarize yourself with a programming language. We have licenses to [Treehouse](https://treehouse.com) that you should consider as your first step. We also have Rust Programming experience amongst the Operations Team which can be leaned on as your start out.

### Learn Ruby

Ruby is a high-level, interpreted programming language. Ruby focuses on simplicity and productivity along with a syntax that reads and writes naturally. Ruby supports procedural, object-oriented and functional programming and is dynamically typed.

Use the aforementioned Treehouse and here are some resources from a Ruby Book Club

- [Learn to Program](https://catalog.princeton.edu/catalog/99125313220106421)
- [Ruby Exercises](https://exercism.org/tracks/ruby/exercises)

### Learn Rust

Rust is a modern systems programming language focusing on safety, speed, and concurrency. It accomplishes these goals by being memory safe without using garbage collection.

Use some of the resources from the Crustaceans Book Club
