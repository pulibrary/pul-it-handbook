## Operations Fellow Training Curriculum

The Early Career Engineer training program is a modular system of topics and pairing suggestions that guides newcomers to our profession. The program includes traditional training resources, but it prioritizes learning by doing. We encourage new engineers to focus on closing tickets while pairing with everyone from senior engineers to junior developers. While we have listed these in order there is no expection that your path will follow these sequentially with the exception of [Module 0](module_0.md) which is likely your launch off point

These components can be used in any combination and order to focus on closing tickets.

## What is DevOps

We define it as a set of practices that combines software development and IT operations. It aims to shorten the systems development life cycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality. DevOps is complementary with Agile software development; several DevOps aspects came from the Agile methodology.
